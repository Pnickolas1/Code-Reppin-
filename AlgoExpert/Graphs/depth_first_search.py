# easy
depth first search

algorithm, very important, must know
exploring, or traversing a graph

deep rather than wide, go down all the way on one branch
 before you explore the next branch

vertices and edges
time = O(V + E)
    - why is v +e, at one point we traverse every node

space = O (V)
    - storing an array of all of vertices3
